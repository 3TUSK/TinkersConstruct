TODO:
* Effect graphics for arrows, throwing knifes, javelins,... MOSTLY DONE
* Separate book explaining the system, text only, sorry folks
* Toolstation GUI for weaponry stuff
* Partbuilder stuff for weaponry stuff?
* Bring bowmaterial stats etc in line?
* Knockback on projectiles knocks towards their moving direction DONEish
* Javelins need lower durability. When leftclick attacking and it has no durability, it should use up 1 ammo and get durability.

maybe give javelins slight armor piercing? or do they have that already?


Ideas:
* Liquid Purple Slime + Obsidian + Metal = Obslimite... Jademite, Obsidimite, Purplemite, Ironslime
    - Lower durability than slime
    - Bouncy.. harvested stuff gets knocked around? Maybe Knockback1?
    - Jagged + Reinforced
* Magma Cube -> Magma Slime Balls -> Tool Material. Slime + Fiery by default, high quality slime!
