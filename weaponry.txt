TODO:
* Effect graphics for arrows, throwing knifes, javelins,...
* Separate book explaining the system, text only, sorry folks
* Turn dagger into a proper projectile
* Reinforced gives a chance that projectiles aren't broken on entity-hit!
* Toolstation GUI for weaponry stuff
* Partbuilder stuff for weaponry stuff?
* Bring bowmaterial stats etc in line?
* Can't have flux or redstone or moss on ammo tools
* Knockback on projectiles knocks towards their moving direction
* Glassmakers Arrows :D

maybe give javelins slight armor piercing? or do they have that already?
