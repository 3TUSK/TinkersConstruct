      "text": "Welcome to the second edition of Materials and You: Surviving the first day and beyond. Within these pages you will find the first steps to making tools with the materials you find.

This book is a magic copy and it updates whenever the original has been modified. Check back occasionally for information on new things.

The first step in making tools is to craft a blank pattern. It is a blank slate to stamp a shape into, providing a reference for future creations.

You can shape a non-metal material in a part builder with the pattern, then combine the parts in the tool station. Patterns can be stored and accessing the pattern chest and spare tool parts in the part chest. Lastly you can convert your trusty old crafting table into a crafting station to keep your in progress projects stashed in it so you don't have to put the materials away should you need to walk away.

Together these make the Tool Workshop. It is recommended you keep all of these nearby when using any of them. I will now cover how to make each item from the Tool Workshop and show you how best they work together."
